# Session Log

**Purpose:** Active, focused session continuity. Kept lean.

**Workflow:** Session start → read this + changelog "Context for Next Session". Session end → check off in planlog, delete completed from here, add context to changelog.

**Performance (speed):** See [prd.md](./prd.md) and [planlog.md](./planlog.md) — Performance (Speed).
