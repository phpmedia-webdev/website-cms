# Session Log

**Purpose:** Active, focused session continuity. Not a living document — kept lean.

**Workflow:**
- **Session start:** Developer announces "start of work session." Open `sessionlog.md`; use **Next up** and **Context** to pick up where you left off.
- **Session end:** Developer announces "end of work session."
  1. Check off any completed `sessionlog` items.
  2. Sync those completions to `planlog.md` (check off corresponding items).
  3. **Delete** those items from `sessionlog.md` to keep it lean.
  4. Add **session context** (what was done, even if incomplete) to `changelog.md` — "Context for Next Session" in the new entry.
- **Abrupt stop:** Same as session end. Update `sessionlog`, sync `planlog`, prune `sessionlog`, add `changelog` context so the next session can continue.

## Current Focus

**Session complete.** Content phase (steps 1–13) done. No active steps.

---

## Next Up

- **None.** Next session: use `planlog.md` for next phase (e.g. Phase 07 CRM, Phase 00 client setup) or new work.

---

## Context

*Use for changelog "Context for Next Session" at session end; then delete.*
