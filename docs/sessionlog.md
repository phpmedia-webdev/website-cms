## Current Focus

- [ ] **Roles transition — next Step 4 (M4) or D7/D8:** M3 recovery doc done ([reference/m3-recovery-procedure.md](./reference/m3-recovery-procedure.md)). Next: M4 central-only read (remove fallback), or continue M5 (D7 tabbed Dashboard + Gating, D8 Superadmin Users). Details in **Roles transition** and **M5 step plan** below.
- [ ] **PHP-Auth integration (broader):** [authplanlog.md](./authplanlog.md) Section 1 (PHP-Auth app) + Section 2 (website-cms). M0 details: [reference/php-auth-integration-clarification.md](./reference/php-auth-integration-clarification.md).

## PHP-Auth Central Store Migration (No Lockout)

**Purpose:** Move website-cms to use PHP-Auth as the central source for users, roles, and assignments. Login stays in Supabase `auth.users`; role and org assignment resolution moves to PHP-Auth so the tenant app does not get locked out during or after migration.

**Principle:** *auth.users* = who can log in (unchanged). *PHP-Auth `users` + `auth_user_organizations`* = who has which role in which org. We populate central first, then dual-read, then write to central, then (optional) read only from central. Always keep a recovery path until central-only is verified.

**References:** PHP-Auth `docs/authplanlog.md` (Section 2: website-cms integration); PHP-Auth `docs/sessionlog.md` (Website-CMS Migration to Central Store). Per-tenant config: `AUTH_ORG_ID`, `AUTH_APPLICATION_ID`, `AUTH_API_KEY` in env (from PHP-Auth when the Application was created).

| Phase | Description | Website-CMS tasks | Status |
|-------|-------------|------------------|--------|
| **M0** | **Connect external app to PHP-Auth** | In the external app (e.g. website-cms): add env (AUTH_BASE_URL, AUTH_ORG_ID, AUTH_APPLICATION_ID, AUTH_API_KEY); implement calls to validate-user (roles) and audit-log (audit events). See **M0 step (detailed)** below. | ✅ Completed |
| **M1** | **Populate central (PHP-Auth)** | No code change in website-cms. In PHP-Auth: ensure your superadmin user (and all current admins) exist in `users` (same `supabase_user_id` as in auth.users) and have correct `auth_user_organizations` for the org that maps to this tenant. Store `AUTH_ORG_ID`, `AUTH_APPLICATION_ID`, `AUTH_APP_API_KEY` in this app’s env. Map tenant id/slug → PHP-Auth Organization UUID. | ✅ Completed |
| **M2** | **Dual-read** | Where you resolve “current user’s role for this tenant” (e.g. `getRoleForCurrentUser`, `getEffectiveFeatureSlugsForCurrentUser`): (1) Call PHP-Auth `POST /api/external/validate-user` with `Authorization: Bearer <session token>` and `X-API-Key: <AUTH_APP_API_KEY>`. (2) If 200 and `data.organizations` includes org with `id === AUTH_ORG_ID`, use that org’s role (and features) for this request. (3) If 401, 403, or 5xx, **fallback** to current logic (user_metadata for superadmin, tenant_user_assignments for tenant admins). Keep writing only to website-cms store (tenant_user_assignments, user_metadata) for now. | ✅ Completed |
| **M3** | **Writes to central** | When assigning a role to a user on a tenant: perform the write in PHP-Auth (e.g. call PHP-Auth API to add user to org with role, or document that Superadmin does it in PHP-Auth UI). Optionally keep syncing to `tenant_user_assignments` during transition. Document **recovery procedure**: if locked out, re-add/fix your user in PHP-Auth (UI or SQL) or temporarily set `user_metadata.role` in auth.users so fallback in M2 still grants access. | 🔄 In progress |
| **M4** | **Central-only read (optional)** | Remove fallback: resolve roles only from PHP-Auth (validate-user). Do only after verifying in staging/production that every relevant user has correct data in PHP-Auth. Keep recovery procedure from M3. Optionally stop writing to tenant_user_assignments and deprecate that table later. | ⏳ Pending |
| **M5** | **Superadmin section UI redesign** | Redesign superadmin UI to align with tenant_sites scope (site mode, membership, coming_soon, current-site only; no multi-site management). Execute after M4. | ⏳ Pending |

## M5 / PHP-Auth SSOT & superadmin redesign — confirmations

- **Tenant site:** Each deployment has one logical tenant site. DB keeps `tenant_sites` (one row per deployment). No site picker in the UI; current site inferred from schema.
- **Feature registry sort:** PHP-Auth `feature_registry` has an **order** field; use it for sort order of the gating list.
- **Roles in website-cms:** Option B — read-only list of roles and their assigned permissions and features (no role creation in website-cms; roles created only in PHP-Auth).
- **Users (superadmin vs tenant admin):** Superadmin → Users and Settings → Users are the same list/capability. Tenant admins must be able to add team members: “add new user” and “assign role” are essential. New roles are created only in the PHP-Auth app and are scoped and made available for all tenant apps.
- **Superadmin Dashboard:** Tabbed design — one tab for **metrics/info** (current site), one tab for **gating** (feature gating table).

## M5 / PHP-Auth SSOT & superadmin redesign — step plan

**Phase A — PHP-Auth contract and docs**

- [x] **A1** Document PHP-Auth model in `docs/reference/` (e.g. php-auth-integration-clarification or dedicated doc): `feature_registry` (scope per app type, **order** for sort), `permission_registry` (global), role = features + permissions + name/slug/label; roles created only in PHP-Auth; website-cms uses label for display, slug for identity. → [reference/php-auth-roles-features-permissions.md](./reference/php-auth-roles-features-permissions.md)
- [x] **A2** Confirm PHP-Auth APIs (or add them): list roles for app type (e.g. scope `website-cms`); list `feature_registry` for scope (include **order**); list role–feature and role–permission assignments for read-only Roles view. Document endpoints and response shapes. → Same doc §2.

**Phase B — Website-cms: role list from PHP-Auth, no role creation**

- [x] **B3** Role picker from PHP-Auth: fetch roles for this app (website-cms scope); return `{ slug, label }` (and optional id). Use for superadmin Users and Settings → Users (replace fixed `listRolesForAssignment()` where used for assignment). → `getRolesForAssignmentFromPhpAuth()` in `src/lib/php-auth/fetch-roles.ts`; fallback to `listRolesForAssignment()`; wired in team API, admin roles API, super page.
- [x] **B4** Remove role creation in website-cms: remove/hide “Create role” and any POST/PATCH that create or update roles. Replace “Roles & Features” with **read-only Roles** page: list roles from PHP-Auth and show each role’s assigned permissions and features (no edit in website-cms). → Done: POST 410; RolesReadOnly; [roleSlug] redirects. API returns features/permissions with parentSlug; we parse and display hierarchy in role detail (Permissions/Features tabs).

**Phase C — Feature registry from PHP-Auth**

- [x] **C5** Tenant feature gating — registry from PHP-Auth: fetch `feature_registry` for scope `website-cms` (use **order** for sort). Use this list for the gating table (labels, ids/slugs). Keep “which features are enabled for this tenant” in website-cms (e.g. `tenant_features`), keyed by feature id/slug from PHP-Auth.

**Phase D — Superadmin UI restructure (M5)**

- [x] **D6** Remove tenant site list and picker: remove “Tenant Sites” from superadmin nav and any “choose a site” flow. Current site from schema only (e.g. `getTenantSiteBySchema`).
- [ ] **D7** New Superadmin Dashboard (tabbed): **Tab 1 — Metrics/info:** current site metrics, site mode, coming soon. **Tab 2 — Gating:** feature gating table (features from PHP-Auth, sorted by **order**; toggles stored in website-cms). Reuse or move content from current tenant-site detail as needed.
- [ ] **D8** Superadmin Users page: same as Settings → Users for current site (non-GPUM; add user, assign role). Role picker from PHP-Auth (B3). Ensure tenant admins retain “add new user” and “assign role” in Settings → Users.
- [x] **D9** Superadmin nav: Dashboard (tabbed), Users, Roles (read-only from PHP-Auth), Code Library, Security. No Tenant Sites. → Done: sidebar has Dashboard, Tenant Users, Roles, Code Library, Security; Roles is read-only from PHP-Auth with list + detail (Permissions/Features hierarchy).

**Phase E — Cleanup and docs**

- [ ] **E10** Deprecate local SSOT for roles/features: document that `admin_roles` / `role_features` (and `feature_registry` where replaced) are not source of truth; PHP-Auth is. No role creation or feature-registry writes from website-cms.
- [ ] **E10a** **PHP-Auth SSOT for role permissions/features (gating):** Display done (roles API returns features/permissions per role; we show in Roles list/detail with hierarchy). **Pending:** Wire `getEffectiveFeatureSlugs` to use PHP-Auth role→features instead of local `role_features` per [reference/php-auth-ssot-roles-features-plan.md](./reference/php-auth-ssot-roles-features-plan.md).
- [ ] **E11** Update sessionlog/planlog and changelog with M5 progress and “Context for Next Session” when appropriate.



**Lockout prevention:** M1 is done before M2 so your account exists in PHP-Auth when we first call central. M2–M3 keep fallback so if PHP-Auth is down or wrong, we still use user_metadata + tenant_user_assignments. Recovery: fix user/assignment in PHP-Auth or temporarily restore user_metadata/fallback in website-cms.

**Execution:** Update the Status column above as each phase is completed. M3 (writes to central) is the current focus. M5 follows M4.

**M0 detail (env, validate-user, audit-log, checklist):** See [reference/php-auth-integration-clarification.md](./reference/php-auth-integration-clarification.md). **When to do M0–M5:** M0 first (env + validate-user + audit-log); M1 after PHP-Auth has org + app + users; M2 dual-read in website-cms; M3 once PHP-Auth has user–org–role API; M4 central-only read; M5 superadmin UI redesign.

## Roles transition: PHP-Auth as SSOT (tenant_sites unchanged)

**Principle:** `tenant_sites` = site mode, lock, membership_enabled, coming_soon, current-site only. Role definitions + assignments = PHP-Auth. Refs: [php-auth-integration-clarification](./reference/php-auth-integration-clarification.md), [php-auth-website-cms-tables-cross-reference](./reference/php-auth-website-cms-tables-cross-reference.md).

| Step | Task | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| **1** | Role definitions from PHP-Auth for UI (dropdowns); stop using `admin_roles`/`role_features` as source. | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Role–features from PHP-Auth for display (read-only Roles list/detail with permissions and features). Gating (getEffectiveFeatureSlugs from PHP-Auth) still optional/pending. | ✅ Done (display) |
| 3 | Role assignment: sync already wired in team + tenant-sites users APIs; document M3 recovery procedure. | ✅ Done ([m3-recovery-procedure.md](./reference/m3-recovery-procedure.md)) |
| 4 | M4 central-only read: remove fallback to `tenant_user_assignments`/user_metadata; resolve only from validate-user. | ← **next** |
| 4a | **PHP-Auth SSOT for role→features (gating):** API and display done. Pending: use role→features in `getEffectiveFeatureSlugs` instead of local `role_features` per [reference/php-auth-ssot-roles-features-plan.md](./reference/php-auth-ssot-roles-features-plan.md). | ⏳ Pending (gating) |
| 5 | Document deprecation of `admin_roles`, `role_features`, read path of `tenant_user_assignments`; tenant_sites unchanged. | ⏳ |

**Dev server:** If you see `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.next/routes-manifest.json'`, delete the `.next` folder and run `pnpm run dev` again.

## Next up

- [x] **Roles API: hierarchical features/permissions** — Done. API provides **parentSlug**; we parse in fetch-roles.ts, build tree (`buildFeatureOrPermissionTree`), display in role detail (Permissions/Features tabs with sort order and hierarchy). See [reference/php-auth-ssot-roles-features-plan.md](./reference/php-auth-ssot-roles-features-plan.md) §7.
- [x] **PHP-Auth roles 403 / display** — Addressed (scope=website-cms default; AUTH_ROLES_SCOPE override). Roles display no-store/cache-buster; debug logging trimmed. If 403 persists, set Application type in PHP-Auth to `website-cms`.
- [ ] **Outbound SMTP emailer + contact activity stream**
  - [ ] Add SMTP/env config and Node.js emailer (e.g. nodemailer or built-in); lib to send email (to, subject, body).
  - [ ] API or server action: send email then create a CRM note for the contact with a dedicated note_type (e.g. `email_sent`); store subject and optional snippet in note body so it appears in the contact activity stream.
  - [ ] Optional: add `email_sent` to tenant CRM note types (Settings) if note types are used for display/filter.
  - [ ] Optional: UI from contact detail to compose and send email (calls send + attach-to-contact flow).
- [ ] **PWA Notifications (admin alerts)** — Admin notifications (new contacts, new form submissions, etc.) will use a PWA push page instead of email. Steps:
  - [ ] **Web app manifest** — Add manifest (name, icons, display, start_url) so the app can be installed on mobile (e.g. Add to home screen).
  - [ ] **Service worker for push** — Register a service worker that can receive push events when the app is in the background; handle push event to show notification (title, body, optional link to contact/form).
  - [ ] **Push subscription storage** — Table (or tenant_settings) to store push subscriptions per admin user: endpoint, p256dh key, auth key; API to POST subscription (after client requests permission and gets subscription) and optionally list/delete.
  - [ ] **VAPID keys** — Generate and store VAPID keys (env); use when sending push from the server (Web Push protocol).
  - [ ] **Backend: send push** — Utility (e.g. `notifyAdmins(tenantId, type, payload)`) that loads subscriptions for the tenant (or relevant admins), builds payload, and sends via Web Push to each endpoint. Call from contact-created and form-submission flows (and any other events you want to notify on).
  - [ ] **Admin PWA/notifications page** — Page (e.g. `/admin/notifications` or `/admin/pwa`) that: requests notification permission; subscribes and sends subscription to API; shows “Add to home screen” instructions and optional QR or link for mobile; only for authenticated admin.
- [ ] **Media: "Copy Shortcode"** — Add a "Copy Shortcode" action on all media items (images, videos, video URLs) in the media library that generates the proper shortcode (e.g. `[[media:id]]`) and copies it to the clipboard for pasting into the editor. Editor integration (Insert media from Tiptap) can be called out as steps when implementing.
  - [ ] **Adds protection to hide URL info** 
- [ ] **Terms and Policys manager** External application but needs a link (always a custom update per tenant)
- [ ] **CRM Sorting** Add ability to sort the CRM contact list by the header items: Last name, First name, Full name, Status, Updated and determin what default sort is. Should be the last activity at top of list - so updated
- [ ] **Form Submission List pagination** This list may grow, need a pagination feature.
  - [ ] **Form Submission List - filter by date range** To assist research. This needs to stack with form type to help narrow search.
---

## Paused / Later

- [ ] **Anychat** Integration work (Anychat push to CRM, VBout sync) and other items in Paused / Later.
- [ ] **VBout Integration** Create API routes to VBout with CRM data.
- [ ] **Integrate with PHPAUTH standalone app** for user access audit logging. 
Superadmin & platform user management; audit logs; break-glass. Plan to add superadmin-only “add superadmin” and “delete user” in the CMS (with safeguards: no self-delete, no delete last superadmin; optional superadmin allowlist). Tenant admins keep add/remove from site only. Standalone auth app (with direct Supabase Auth access) will be used as break-glass: create a superadmin in an emergency and revoke compromised accounts; no separate master-challenge lockout in the CMS for now. Audit: use the standalone app’s audit_logs table as the single store; CMS will write auth/user events with application_id (from auth_applications), assign application_id per fork from the standalone app, and use login_source (e.g. website-cms) for filtering. Plan steps (migrations, APIs, UI) to be detailed as the plan is finalized.
