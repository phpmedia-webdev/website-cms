## Package Management
- Always use pnpm instead of npm for package management
- Use `pnpm install` instead of `npm install`
- Use `pnpm add [package]` instead of `npm install [package]`
- Use `pnpm run [script]` instead of `npm run [script]`
- Use `pnpm audit` instead of `npm audit`
- Use `pnpm remove [package]` instead of `npm uninstall [package]`
- Use `pnpm update` instead of `npm update`

## Additional Rules
- The server is always running on port 3000
- Use available MCP servers for knowledgebase and understanding
- Place components in the root `/components` directory and combine by usecase in subdirectories
- Always use `/components/ui` for shadcn/ui base components when building new UI components
- Fetch logs from the console
- Suggest performance improvements
- Point out potential security issues and suggest solutions
- Don't install packages unless asked
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication

## Git Submodule Management (Optional)
- **If using submodules:** Always refresh shared documentation submodules at the beginning of each coding session
- **Command:** Run `git submodule update --remote` to pull latest shared content
- **Purpose:** Ensure access to latest global PRD, technical specs, and shared documentation
- **Location:** `docs/shared/` typically contains read-only references to external repositories
- **Never modify:** Files in submodule directories are read-only - changes must be made in the source repository

## Context7 MCP Server Usage
- **Always use Context7 MCP server** for enhanced knowledge and context
- **Before coding:** Query Context7 for relevant documentation and best practices
- **For libraries/frameworks:** Use `mcp_context7_resolve-library-id` to find official docs
- **For documentation:** Use `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` to fetch up-to-date docs
- **Search strategy:** Query Context7 when working with:
  - Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
  - Supabase, Drizzle ORM, Express.js
  - Authentication, security, database design
  - Multi-component architecture patterns
  - Deployment and CI/CD best practices
- **Integration approach:** Use Context7 insights to inform coding decisions and suggest modern patterns
- **Documentation priority:** Always check Context7 before implementing new features or solving complex problems
