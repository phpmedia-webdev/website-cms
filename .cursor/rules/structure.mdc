## Documentation Structure

This document defines the structure and purpose of all documentation files in the project.

### Documentation Directory

All project documentation lives in the `docs/` folder. The root directory should remain clean without README or documentation files.

## Core Documentation Files

### `docs/prd.md` - Product Requirements Document

**Purpose**: Comprehensive product specification and architecture documentation.

**Contents**:
- Project overview and goals
- Technology stack
- Architecture details (single app model, routing, multi-schema strategy)
- Component architecture (developer-centric approach)
- Archive & restore system design
- CI/CD & maintenance strategy
- Content types (blog posts, galleries, media, forms)
- Design system & branding
- Authentication
- API endpoints
- Getting started guide
- Deployment instructions
- Project structure
- Development guidelines
- Key differentiators
- Future enhancements

**When to Update**:
- Major architecture changes
- New feature specifications
- Technology stack changes
- Deployment model updates

### `docs/changelog.md` - Change History

**Purpose**: Track all completed changes, fixes, and releases.

**Format**:
- Follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format
- Uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
- Reverse chronological order (latest first)
- Date-stamped entries in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- Categorized by version: `[Unreleased]`, `[Version]`

**Contents**:
- **Only completed changes** - no planning items
- Version releases with dates
- Bug fixes
- New features implemented
- Breaking changes
- Deprecations
- Security updates

**When to Update**:
- After completing features or fixes
- At the end of each development session
- When releasing versions
- When deprecating features

**Changelog Pattern**:
- **ALWAYS** include a date and time stamp in entries: `### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM CT - Description`
- Use format: `### 2026-01-21 14:30 CT - Feature Description` (includes date, time, and timezone)
- Time format: 24-hour format (HH:MM) with Central Time (CT) timezone indicator
- When moving items from "Unreleased" to a version, use format: `## [VERSION] - YYYY-MM-DD`
- Date should reflect when the change was completed/deployed
- Never leave entries without timestamps - all entries must have date and time
- Multiple entries per day are supported and should include different times

**Structure**:
```markdown
# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM CT - Feature/Fix Description
- Change item 1
- Change item 2

### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM CT - Another Feature (same day, different time)
- Change item 1
- Change item 2

## [Version] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- New features

### Changed
- Changes to existing functionality

### Fixed
- Bug fixes

### Removed
- Removed features
```

**Cross-Reference**: Links to `planlog.md` for planned work.

### `docs/planlog.md` - Planning and Backlog

**Purpose**: Track planned work, implementation phases, future enhancements, and backlog items.

**Contents**:
- Implementation phases with detailed tasks (organized by priority)
- Active planning items with checkboxes
- Feature backlog
- Technical debt items
- Future enhancements
- Architecture features (planned)
- Architecture notes and implementation details
- Notes and considerations

**Format**:
- Uses checkboxes `- [ ]` for incomplete items
- Uses `- [x]` for completed items
- Organized by phase/category with priority order
- Detailed task breakdowns with sub-tasks
- **IMPORTANT**: Items are NEVER deleted - they remain in the document and are simply checked off when completed

**When to Update**:
- When identifying new work
- When planning features
- During sprint planning
- When items are completed (check off the checkbox, keep the item)
- When adding new phases or tasks

**Workflow**:
1. Add new items to appropriate phase/section
2. **Check off items** (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`) as work progresses
3. **Keep completed items in planlog.md** - do NOT delete them
4. Add summary entries to `changelog.md` at session end (but keep detailed items in planlog)
5. Review and prioritize regularly
6. Move completed phases to "Completed Phases" section if desired for organization

**Key Principle**: 
- **Planlog is a living document** - items stay forever, just get checked off
- This provides a complete history of what was planned and what was completed
- Completed items serve as reference for what has been done
- Only move items to changelog for summary/version entries, not for deletion

**Cross-Reference**: Links to `changelog.md` for version summaries, but detailed task history remains in planlog.

## Documentation Principles

### Separation of Concerns

1. **Planning vs. History**: 
   - `planlog.md` = What we plan to do
   - `changelog.md` = What we've done

2. **Specification vs. History**:
   - `prd.md` = What the system is/does (current state)
   - `changelog.md` = How we got here (changes over time)

3. **Structure vs. Content**:
   - `.cursor/rules/structure.mdc` = How docs are organized (this file)
   - Other docs = Actual project content

### Maintenance Workflow

1. **During Development**:
   - Add planned items to `planlog.md`
   - Check off items as work progresses

2. **End of Session** (Single Commit & Push):
   - **Update all documentation first:**
     - Check off completed items in `planlog.md` (do NOT delete them)
     - Add summary entries to `changelog.md` for completed work
     - Update `prd.md` if architecture/specs changed
   - **Then commit and push everything together:**
     - Single commit with all changes (code + documentation)
     - Single push to repository
     - Commit message should summarize all work: "Session wrapup: [summary of work]"
   - **Why single push?**
     - Atomic: All related changes together
     - Clean history: One commit per session
     - Efficient: No "forgot to update changelog" follow-up commits
     - Better workflow: Update docs first, then commit everything at once

3. **Before Release**:
   - Review and consolidate `changelog.md` entries
   - Version the release in `changelog.md`
   - Update `prd.md` if needed

### Versioning

- **Changelog**: Uses semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- **PRD**: Updated for significant changes, not every patch
- **Planlog**: No versioning, always current

### Cross-References

All documentation files should include appropriate cross-references:
- `changelog.md` → `planlog.md` (for planned work)
- `planlog.md` → `changelog.md` (for completed work)
- Both reference `prd.md` (for specifications)

## File Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `planlog.md`, `changelog.md`
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose
- Keep extensions: `.md` for Markdown, `.mdc` for Markdown documentation structure

## Document Location

All documentation files must be in the `docs/` directory:
```
docs/
├── prd.md          # Product Requirements Document
├── changelog.md    # Change history (completed work - summaries)
└── planlog.md      # Planning and backlog (detailed tasks - items stay, just get checked off)
```

**Note**: `planlog.md` contains the detailed implementation plan with all phases and tasks. Items are never deleted - they remain in the document and are checked off when completed. This provides a complete history of planned and completed work.

The documentation structure specification (this file) lives in `.cursor/rules/structure.mdc` to be part of the cursor rules system.

## Additional Notes

- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Review documentation structure periodically
- Don't duplicate information across files
- Use consistent formatting and style
- Include dates in changelog entries (required)
- Use checkboxes in planlog for tracking
