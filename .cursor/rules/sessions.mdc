# Sessions and documentation

This document defines (1) how project documentation is structured and (2) how work sessions are defined and executed.

---

## Part 1: Documentation structure

All project documentation lives in the `docs/` folder. The root directory stays clean (no README or docs at project root).

### Core documentation files

These files live in the root of `docs/`.

#### `docs/prd.md` — Product Requirements Document

- **Purpose:** Product specification and architecture.
- **Contents:** Overview, goals, tech stack, architecture (single app, routing, multi-schema), component architecture, archive/restore, CI/CD, content types, design system, auth, API, getting started, deployment, structure, guidelines, differentiators, future work.
- **Update when:** Major architecture or feature changes, tech stack or deployment changes.

#### `docs/prd-technical.md` — Technical specifications

- **Purpose:** Implementation patterns and technical specs. Consult with `prd.md` to understand what we are building.

#### `docs/changelog.md` — Change history

- **Purpose:** Completed changes, fixes, and releases only (no planning).
- **Format:** [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), reverse chronological, date-stamped `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- **Contents:** Completed changes, version releases, bug fixes, new features, breaking changes, deprecations, security updates.
- **Writing style:** Concise. What changed, not how. Key files only. Minimal code. **Always include a "Context for Next Session" section** at the top of each entry (current state, what’s ready to test, where to continue, key files, important decisions).
- **Changelog pattern:**
  - Entry format: `### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM CT - Description` (24-hour, Central Time).
  - Version format: `## [VERSION] - YYYY-MM-DD`.
  - Multiple entries per day allowed (use different times).
- **Update when:** After features/fixes, at end of each session, on release or deprecation.
- **Cross-reference:** Links to `planlog.md` for planned work.

**Example structure:**
```markdown
# Changelog
## [Unreleased]
### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM CT - Feature/Fix Description
- Context for Next Session: ...
- Change item 1
### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM CT - Another (same day)
- ...
## [Version] - YYYY-MM-DD
### Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed
- ...
```

#### `docs/planlog.md` — Planning and backlog

- **Purpose:** Planned work, phases, backlog, technical debt, future enhancements.
- **Format:** Checkboxes `- [ ]` / `- [x]`, organized by phase/priority. **Items are never deleted** — only checked off when done.
- **Writing style:** Concise, task-oriented. What to do, not how. Link to `prd-technical.md` for patterns.
- **Workflow:** Add items → check off as done → keep completed items in planlog; add summaries to changelog at session end.
- **Update when:** New work, planning, or when items are completed (check off only).
- **Cross-reference:** `changelog.md`, `sessionlog.md`.

#### `docs/sessionlog.md` — Session continuity

- **Purpose:** Handoff for the next session. **Kept lean** — not a living archive.
- **Contents:** Current focus, next up (often pointing to planlog), and context used to write changelog "Context for Next Session" (remove that block after it’s in changelog).
- **Update when:** Start of session (read; optionally adjust Next up). End of session (check off, sync to planlog, delete completed items from sessionlog, use context for changelog).
- **Cross-reference:** Planlog for next up and sync; changelog receives context at session end.

### Documentation principles

**Separation of concerns**

- **Planning vs. history:** `planlog.md` = what we plan; `changelog.md` = what we did (+ context for next session).
- **Session handoff:** `sessionlog.md` = focus, next up, handoff context; lean; items removed after sync to planlog. Session context lives in changelog.
- **Spec vs. history:** `prd.md` = what the system is; `changelog.md` = how we got here.
- **Structure vs. content:** `.cursor/rules/sessions.mdc` = how docs are organized; other docs = content.

**Versioning**

- Changelog: semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). PRD: when specs change. Planlog: no versioning.

**Cross-references**

- Changelog → planlog; planlog → changelog, sessionlog; sessionlog → planlog; all reference `prd.md` for specs.

**File naming and location**

- Lowercase with hyphens: `planlog.md`, `changelog.md`, `sessionlog.md`. All in `docs/`:
  - `docs/prd.md`, `docs/prd-technical.md`, `docs/changelog.md`, `docs/planlog.md`, `docs/sessionlog.md`
- Keep docs updated with code; avoid duplication; consistent formatting; dates required in changelog; checkboxes in planlog.

## Part 2: How sessions are defined and executed

The developer announces the **start** and **end** of work sessions. Sessions are short sprints focused on a phase (from `planlog.md`).

### Starting a new work session.

A developer typically starts a new chat when context becomes too large, to prevent performance degradation and keep responses focused.

1. Get today’s date and time for reference.
2. Read the docs in the `.cursor` folder.
3. Read the root documents in the `docs` folder.
4. Consult `prd.md` and `prd-technical.md` to see what we are building.
5. Consult the **last entry** in `changelog.md` for previous context to carry into this session.
6. Consult `sessionlog.md` for any open items to complete.
7. Review `planlog.md` to set the next development focus.

### Ending a work session

1. Use the current chat/session to **check off** completed items in `sessionlog.md`.
2. **Sync** those completions to `planlog.md` (check off the same items there). Do not delete items from planlog.
3. **Remove** completed items from `sessionlog.md` to keep it lean.
4. **Add a changelog entry:** Write a concise summary of session work and a **"Context for Next Session"** section (current state, what’s ready to test, where to continue, key files, important decisions). Use the sessionlog context, then clear that context block from sessionlog.
5. Update `prd.md` if architecture or specs changed.
6. Pause and allow developer to review update to documents.
7. **Commit and push** all changes (code + docs) in a single commit and push; e.g. message: `Session wrapup: [brief summary]`.

Do documentation updates **before** the final commit and push so context is captured once and the next session can pick up from changelog and sessionlog.
