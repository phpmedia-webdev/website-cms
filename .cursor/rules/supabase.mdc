# Supabase (this project)

## Project ref (safe to store here)

- **Project ref for this repo:** `sjmhierrkokthcpmyzxw`
- Get it from: Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → General → Reference ID.
- Use only for: `supabase link --project-ref <ref>` and `supabase db push`. Never put service role key, database password, or JWT secret in rules or in the repo.

## Running migrations (manual)

- **Do not use Supabase CLI for migrations.** Run SQL manually.
- **Where:** Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor.
- **How:** Copy the contents of each migration file from `supabase/migrations/` (in filename order: 023, 024, …, 052, 053, etc.) and paste into the SQL Editor, then Run. Run one migration at a time, or batch in order if you prefer.
- When adding new migrations: (1) List `supabase/migrations/` to find the latest numeric prefix (e.g. 053), increment by one (054). (2) Create the file as `XXX_description.sql`. (3) In the **top comment header** of the script, include a line: `-- File: XXX_description.sql` so you can scan Supabase SQL Editor run history and match by filename. (4) Direct the user: "Copy the contents of `supabase/migrations/XXX_name.sql` and run in Supabase SQL Editor."
